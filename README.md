# AirBnB Clone

## Description
This project is a simplified version of AirBnB, focusing on building a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects. The CLI allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete various objects such as users, places, cities, etc. It also provides functionalities for serialization/deserialization of objects and storage management.

## Command Interpreter
### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script.

### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter various commands to interact with the system. Here are some example commands:

- `create <classname>`: Creates a new instance of the specified class.
- `show <classname> <id>`: Displays information about the specified instance.
- `update <classname> <id> <attribute> <value>`: Updates the specified attribute of an instance.
- `destroy <classname> <id>`: Deletes the specified instance.
- `all <classname>`: Lists all instances of the specified class.
- `quit`: Exits the command interpreter.
